What is it?
-----------

These  are  six  OS 3.5 icons I drawed while being bored.  They are stuffed
with  the  fancy OS 3.5 glow effect, invented by Matt Chaput.  Most of them
only  look  really  good on a light gray background (the original workbench
background  color) because of their anti-aliasing.  They will probably look
very ugly on a black or very dark background.

Icons available in this archive are:

- a photographic image of a LogiTech 3 button mouse
- a photographic image of a crankshaft (maybe someone has use for it)
- an icon for PageStream
- an icon for Voyager3
- a photorealistic FujiFilm MX-700 icon
- a FujiFilm MX-700 drawer icon

How to use
----------

Since  "IconUpdate"  does not work with OS 3.5 icons anymore, you will have
to  use  Icon  Information to change the icon(s).  To do this, follow these
steps:

1. open the drawers with the old icons AND the one with the new icons.
2. select the icon you want to change by clicking once with your keft mouse
   button. (You may shift select more icons)
3. choose "Information" in the "Icons" menu.
4. drag the new icon and drop it onto the icon image shown in the Icon
   Information window.
5. click "Save" in the Icon Information window.

Tell  me  if  you know of a replacement for "IconUpdate" that works with OS
3.5 icons!
